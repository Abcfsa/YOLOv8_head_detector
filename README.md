# YOLOv8_head_detector
model trained for head detection,graduation project 2023-24
## Info
These model are trained with [yolov8](https://github.com/ultralytics/ultralytics) on the dataset [SCUT-HEAD](https://github.com/HCIILAB/SCUT-HEAD-Dataset-Release) part A and part B.
medium.pt is bigger and more accurate while nano.pt is smaller and faster.
## Usage
If you already have ultralytics/yolov8 installed,then just choose one of these two models to do your prediction jobs.
Else first enter these in the command line 
```bash
pip install ultralytics
pip install opencv-python
pip install pandas
```
Basic usage:
```bash
python example.py --model path/to/model_weights.pt --source path/to/img_folder --output path/to/save.csv --mode track/detect
```
## Output format
- Depends on mode.If mode is detect,then the columns would be `["name","xmin","ymin","xmax","ymax"]`.
  If mode is track,then there will be an `"id"` column as well.
- Output has no index column
- "xmin",...,"ymax" are all normalized to 0-1.
